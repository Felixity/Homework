# Project 1 - Homework

Homework is a app that allows teachers to browse homework assignments and submissions. 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] A teacher can see a list of assignments with title and due date.
- [X] Tapping an assignment shows a top section with the assignment details, followed by a list of student submissions for the assignment. The list contains the student's name, avatar, and the date of submission. 
- [X] Tapping a submission shows the full submission details.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] pull to refresh the list of assignments and submissions 
- [X] Load more assignments when scrolling to the bottom 
- [ ] Add a button that shows a view to create a new assignment. The assignment should be added to the assignment view and be selectable. The new assignment should only be created on the client (no API call to create the assignment on the server).
